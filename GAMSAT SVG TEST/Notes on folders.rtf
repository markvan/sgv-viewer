\f0\fs24 \cf0 Notes:\
\
Folder 1  has original word documents directly download from source (control)\
\
Folder 2 has the original word files converted directly to SVG via https://convertio.co/ - these are exactly as converted with no further adjustments. All these can be opened and edited in Adobe Illustrator but are not practically editable and the Data and Diagram stimuli do not appear complete in AI, but show perfectly in a browser window, and all SVG\'92s include the A4 page the were created on including the margins.\
\
Folder 3 uses the same files as folder 2, but each one has been adjusted in Illustrator to remove borders and unused page space, as well as unusual random elements created during the original conversion.\
\
Folder 4 has SVG\'92s exported directly from newly created Adobe illustrator files.}
